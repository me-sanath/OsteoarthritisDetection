# Osteoarthritis Detection
Project was aimed to create a detection model for Osteoarthritis using tensorflow.
This was a learning project and an experiment to improve the F1 score of the previously trained model. Dataset for the training was taken from kaggle which included 2000+ imagesof both Normal and affected cases.

Model was trained using Mobilenet SSD pretrained model Tensorflow.

## How to run
+ Clone or download the git repository
> Clone the repository on local machine for running the scripts.
+ Create a virtual environment and activate [Here's how to do that.](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
> VIrtual enviroment gives abiltiy to isolate the python development project from system installed python allowing users to avoid breaking system tools or other projects.
+ Install dependencies by : 
> Dependencies are the supporting libraries imported in the main.py file which are needed to be installed to run.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
+ Edit the image path

>Add the image path in main.py file on which image detection is to be run. 

+ Run the 'main.py'
